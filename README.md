In today's fast changing world, managing medical appointments and services efficiently is crucial for both healthcare providers and patients.By using artificial intelligence, we can create a comprehensive system that changes medical appointment scheduling. By considering factors like patient preferences, healthcare provider availability, medical service requirements, and even historical data, the system can intelligently recommend suitable time slots for appointments.

## Problem statement 
Current appointment scheduling systems depend on manual processes, leading to long wait times, inefficiency and communication gaps.
Patients struggle with finding convenient appointment slots, healthcare providers  struggle with managing varying schedules, and valuable resources are wasted due to no-shows and not fully utilized time slots.
