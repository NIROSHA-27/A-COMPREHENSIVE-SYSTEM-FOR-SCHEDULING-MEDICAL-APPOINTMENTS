In today's fast changing world, managing medical appointments and services efficiently is crucial for both healthcare providers and patients.By using artificial intelligence, we can create a comprehensive system that changes medical appointment scheduling. By considering factors like patient preferences, healthcare provider availability, medical service requirements, and even historical data, the system can intelligently recommend suitable time slots for appointments.

## Problem statement 
Current appointment scheduling systems depend on manual processes, leading to long wait times, inefficiency and communication gaps.
Patients struggle with finding convenient appointment slots, healthcare providers  struggle with managing varying schedules, and valuable resources are wasted due to no-shows and not fully utilized time slots.
Existing scheduling systems often lack intelligence in assigning appointments.

## About the project

The project involves a multifaceted set of challenges that need to be addressed to create an effective AI-powered system for medical appointments and services like optimizing appointment scheduling , predicting patient demand ,personalized patient experience and security.
We are cretaed a website for booking a appointments in a particular time period. By using 
this they are imporve the hospital maintenance. In this project we are created the frontend and backend and also implemets the Aritifical Intelligents Algorithm. We complted this project by agile methodology. 
We have collected data from Kalasalingam Hospital, and we are preparing to predict the number of patients that will come in the future."
  

## Technical implemntaion 
For Front end we are used a HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap. For Backend we are used a PHP, MySQL. We implemeted the Deep Learing (LSTM Algorithm) for Perideing the how many paten will come in future. 

Organized flow of work :

## Techstacks used 
`HTML` , `CSS` , `JavaScript` , `BootStrap` , `PHP` , `MYSQL` , `Logistic regression`

## How to run locally 
explain detailed steps to run your project locally , example to run a react application 
- step 1 : Created a Frontend using a HTML, CSS, JavaStript, Bootstrap
- step 2 : Created a Backend using a PHP, MySql
- Step 3 : Exporting the data from the database and convert into the .csv file  
- Step 4 : Predict the number of patients that will come in the future using a LSTM Algorithm.

# What's next ?
We aim to enhance this project by automating data extraction from the backend and implementing additional AI features.
